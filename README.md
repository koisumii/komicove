# Sample Proposal - Pok√©mon the Trading Card Game

> [!note]
> This was taken from a project I did in university so the scope is **much** larger than what I'm expecting from you in terms of number of features!

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

Welcome to Kom√≠Cove, a tranquil yet engaging fishing game set in a picturesque seaside village. In this cozy game, players step into the role of an angler and explore the serene waters of Kom√≠Cove to catch a variety of fish, including Common, Rare, and Legendary species. Each successful catch adds to the player‚Äôs score, which is essential to surviving the day and progressing to the next. However, the journey isn‚Äôt all smooth sailing, as players must reel in fish before they escape and meet daily score thresholds within a time limit to avoid losing. As the days progress, players can unlock upgraded fishing rods that slightly boost the chances of encountering rare and legendary fish, adding a layer of excitement to this otherwise peaceful adventure.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

### Day Progression & Residue Score
At the start of each day, players cast their line and begin fishing to meet the day‚Äôs score threshold within a set timer. If the player exceeds the threshold (e.g., scores 80 points when only 50 are required), the leftover score (30 points) carries over to the next day, giving the player a head start.

### Fish Types
Players can encounter three types of fish while exploring the fish-rich waters of Kom√≠Cove:
- **Common Fish**: The most abundant and easiest to catch, offering lower score values.
- **Rare Fish**: Moderately challenging with higher score values and lower spawn rates.
- **Legendary Fish**: Exceptionally rare, highly valuable, and most likely to appear with upgraded rods.

### Fishing Mechanics
Once hooked, players must press the `SPACEBAR` repeatedly to reel in fish. Each fish has hitpoints that decrease with every press of the spacebar. If the player stops reeling or takes too long, the fish escapes. 

### Selling Fish
Fish are automatically sold as soon as they are caught, converting them into score points instantly. This ensures players consistently earn points toward meeting the day‚Äôs threshold without the risk of forgetting to sell their catch.

### Rod Upgrades
Upon reaching specific score milestones (e.g., 100 points), players are rewarded with upgraded fishing rods for free, without costing or deducting points from their total. These rods improve the chances of encountering Rare and Legendary fish.

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Win**: Meet or exceed the daily score threshold within the time limit to progress to the next day.
- **Loss**: Fail to meet the score threshold before time runs out, results in a Game Over.

### üßµ Wireframes

> [!note]
> Your wireframes don't have to be super polished. They can even be black/white and hand drawn. I'm just looking for a rough idea about what you're visualizing.

![Main Menu](./assets/images/Main-Menu.png)

-   _Let's Play_ will navigate to the main game.
-   _Upload Cards_ will navigation to the forms for uploading and parsing the data files for the game.
-   _Change Log_ will navigate the user to a page with a list of features/changes that have been implemented throughout the development of the game.

![Game Board](./assets/images/Game-Board.png)

We want to keep the GUI as simple and clear as possible by having cards with relevant images to act as a way for the user to intuitively navigate the game. We want to implement a layout that would look like as if one were playing a match of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game with physical cards in real life. Clicking on any of the cards will reveal that card's details to the player.

### üé® Assets

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

We plan on following trends already found in other trading card video games, such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Online, Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering Arena, and Gwent.

The GUI will be kept simple and playful, as to make sure the game is easy to understand what each component does and is, as well as light hearted to keep to the Pok√©mon theme.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images

-   Most images will be used from the well known community driven wikipedia site, [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
-   Especially their [Trading Card Game section](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Full_Art_card_(TCG)>).

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

For fonts, a simple sans-serif like Roboto will look quite nice. It's a font that is legible, light on storage size, and fun to keep with the theme we're going for. We also used a more cartoonish Pokemon font for the title screen.

-   [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### üîä Sounds

All sounds were taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) for the actions pertaining to cards.

-   [Shuffle cards](https://freesound.org/people/VKProduktion/sounds/217502/)
-   [Flip card](https://freesound.org/people/Splashdust/sounds/84322/)
