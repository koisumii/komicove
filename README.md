# Kom√≠Cove Àñìç¢÷¥÷¥‡ªãü¶à

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

Welcome to Kom√≠Cove, a tranquil yet engaging fishing game set in a picturesque seaside village. In this cozy game, players step into the role of an angler and explore the serene waters of Kom√≠Cove to catch a variety of fish, including Common, Rare, and Legendary species. Each successful catch adds to the player‚Äôs score, which is essential to surviving the day and progressing to the next. However, the journey isn‚Äôt all smooth sailing, as players must reel in fish before they escape and meet daily score thresholds within a time limit to avoid losing. As the days progress, players can unlock upgraded fishing rods that slightly boost the chances of encountering rare and legendary fish, adding a layer of excitement to this otherwise peaceful adventure.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

### Day Progression & Residue Score
At the start of each day, players cast their line and begin fishing to meet the day‚Äôs score threshold within a set timer. If the player exceeds the threshold (e.g., scores 80 points when only 50 are required), the leftover score (30 points) carries over to the next day, giving the player a head start.

### Fish Types
Players can encounter three types of fish while exploring the fish-rich waters of Kom√≠Cove:
- **Common Fish**: The most abundant and easiest to catch, offering lower score values.
- **Rare Fish**: Moderately challenging with higher score values and lower spawn rates.
- **Legendary Fish**: Exceptionally rare, highly valuable, and most likely to appear with upgraded rods.

### Fishing Mechanics
Once hooked, players must press the `SPACEBAR` repeatedly to reel in fish. Each fish has hitpoints that decrease with every press of the spacebar. If the player stops reeling or takes too long, the fish escapes. 

### Selling Fish
Fish are automatically sold as soon as they are caught, converting them into score points instantly. This ensures players consistently earn points toward meeting the day‚Äôs threshold without the risk of forgetting to sell their catch.

### Rod Upgrades
Upon reaching specific score milestones (e.g., 100 points), players are rewarded with upgraded fishing rods for free, without costing or deducting points from their total. These rods improve the chances of encountering Rare and Legendary fish.

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Win**: Meet or exceed the daily score threshold within the time limit to progress to the next day.
- **Loss**: Fail to meet the score threshold before time runs out, results in a Game Over.

### üßµ Wireframes

### üé® Assets

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

We take inspiration from games with similar elements (fishing), such as Stardew Valley and Minecraft, and decide to find a balance between reality and game to provide players with relaxing and fun gameplay.

The GUI is kept minimalistic, with color palettes that resemble art style of in-game character and terrain - pixel, cartoon, bright.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images

-   Most images in game (including character, equipment, tile) will be taken from [Sunnyside World](https://danieldiggle.itch.io/sunnyside), a free asset pack available on `itch.io`.

-   Certain fish icons are taken from [Bagatan Tsuri : Let's go Fishing!](https://pixerelia.itch.io/lets-go-fishing) and [Cozy Fishing](https://shubibubi.itch.io/cozy-fishing), asset packs available on `itch.io`.
-   Keyboard images for input prompt are taken from [Input Prompts Pixel 16√ó](https://kenney-assets.itch.io/input-prompts-pixel-16), a free asset pack on `itch.io`.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

Roboto is selected for its readability.
Stardew Valley is used for the game title to place emphasis on relation between the game and nature with the wooden texture, creating a casual atmosphere suitable for relaxing gameplay.
